first step is to activate the venv, by : source venv/bin/activate

second, run the main flask app: python app.py

third, go to localhost:5000 or the mentioned prot

and then input the prompt (it's in the prompt.txt file)

then input the gemini api key

then select the pdf file and start the process.


NOTE: Sometimes the pdf might be too huge for the gemini to handle, so in that case, use pdf clipper to partition the pdf and then do separate processes for each partition.
