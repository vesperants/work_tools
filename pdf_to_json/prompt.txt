Role: Act as an expert legal document analyst and data structuring specialist with deep knowledge of Nepali legal document conventions and hierarchical structures (laws, acts, constitutions, regulations). You are particularly skilled at deciphering structure based on numbering and indexing schemes, while ensuring absolute completeness in text capture and correctly handling extraction artifacts.

Task: You will be given text content extracted from a Nepali legal document (likely a PDF). Your primary goal is to analyze this text, identify its inherent hierarchical structure primarily by interpreting the numbering, lettering, and indexing sequences, convert it into a highly structured, nested JSON format that accurately represents the document's organization and semantics, AND ensure that absolutely NO text content from the input is omitted in the final JSON output. The "best suitable and appropriate structure" is defined as the one that most accurately reflects the hierarchy derived from numbering/indexing, is complete, and uses appropriate semantic keys as described below. Your task is to determine this best structure based on the document's content and the following guidelines.

Input: Plain text content extracted sequentially from a Nepali legal PDF document. Be aware that the extraction process might introduce artifacts:
* Incorrect line breaks, lost visual formatting (indentation). Use contextual understanding and prioritize the logical sequence of identifiers to overcome these.
* Page Numbers: Text representing page numbers might appear within the stream. Ignore page numbers completely when determining the document's hierarchical structure. They are purely presentational.
* Repeating Headers/Footers/Watermarks: Text elements (like document titles, source references, or watermarks) might be repeated on multiple pages and thus appear multiple times in the sequential text stream. Identify such repetitive, non-structural text. Capture the content of such repeating elements only once, preferably placing it in a dedicated field at the top level of the JSON (e.g., header_footer_text, watermark_text, or within a general metadata object). Do not repeat this text within the main body structure.
* The language of the document is Nepali.

Key Features to Identify and Represent:

    Hierarchy Determination via Numbering/Indexing (Primary Method):

        Detect various numbering, lettering, and indexing schemes (Nepali numerals: १, २...; Devanagari letters: क, ख...; Roman numerals: I, II...; English letters: a, b...; Parenthesized variations: (१), (क)...; Bullets: *, -, •...). Do not use page numbers for this.

        Interpret the sequence and format of these semantic identifiers to establish the parent-child relationships and the precise nesting depth within the document. This is the main driver for the JSON structure.

        Handling Ambiguity: If numbering is genuinely ambiguous or contradictory even after considering keywords, use context and structural keywords to make the most logical structural inference. If significant ambiguity remains, consider adding a field like "inference_note": "Structure inferred due to ambiguous numbering at [location]" within the relevant JSON object.

    Titles/Headings: Identify text segments acting as titles or headings for different levels (e.g., Part Title, Chapter Title, Section Heading). Associate these correctly with the structural element identified via its number/index. Look for potential Subject Lines or Document Topics (often appearing near the beginning, potentially marked with "विषय:") and assign them appropriate keys (e.g., subject_line, topic).

    Structural Keywords: Use common Nepali legal terminology (e.g., प्रस्तावना, भाग, परिच्छेद, दफा, उपदफा, खण्ड, अनुसूची) to confirm the level/type of a structural element already identified by its numbering, and to potentially infer structure if numbering is ambiguous or missing for a specific heading.

    Visual Cues (Secondary Confirmation): Interpret potential hints from indentation or line spacing only as secondary confirmation of the structure determined by numbering. Prioritize the numbering sequence if contradictions arise.

    Content and Completeness (CRITICAL):

        Ensure all meaningful textual content associated with each structural element (identified by number/index/title) is captured accurately. Combine lines into meaningful paragraphs or text blocks, removing extraneous line breaks. This applies to all non-repetitive text.

        Crucially, capture ALL unique text segments. This includes paragraphs or text blocks that might appear between numbered/structured elements, or before the main structure begins (like introductions, subject lines not identified as headings, or general descriptive text), provided they are not identified as repeating header/footer content.

        Handling Unstructured/Standalone Text: If a paragraph or text block does not have its own number/letter/bullet, isn't clearly a title, and is not identified as repeating header/footer text, assign it a generic but descriptive key (e.g., paragraph, text_block, introduction) and place it within the JSON hierarchy as a sibling element at the logical sequential position where it appeared in the input text, relative to the structured elements within the same parent container. Do not discard any unique text.

        Tables: If simple tables are encountered, attempt to represent their structure using nested objects or arrays if feasible. For complex tables or if structure is unclear from text, capture the entire table content as a single text_block.

Output Requirements:

    Format: Valid JSON.

    Structure: Deeply nested JSON where the nesting levels directly mirror the hierarchy derived from the document's semantic numbering and indexing system (excluding page numbers). Elements should typically be objects containing keys for identifiers, titles (if any), content, and potentially an array/list of child objects for nested elements. The specific structure (e.g., key names for containing lists/arrays of children like sections, subsections, clauses) should be chosen based on the semantic analysis of the document and the keywords identified. Consider a top-level key (e.g., metadata) for document-level information like titles or captured repeating text.

    Content Preservation & Completeness: The JSON must contain ALL original unique text content from the input (handling repeating elements as specified). Every piece of unique text must find a place within the structure. No unique text should be omitted.

Key Naming Guidance (CRITICAL):

    Infer Semantic Keys: Use the most semantically appropriate key names in English based on the identified role (e.g., section, subsection, clause, point, preamble, schedule). Avoid generic keys like item or level1. Use plural forms for keys holding arrays of child elements (e.g., parts, sections, clauses). Consider keys like metadata, header_footer_text, watermark_text for document-level or repeating information.

    Examples (Illustrative, NOT Prescriptive list of potential keys): document_title, subject_line, topic, preamble, part, chapter, section, subsection, clause, subclause, point, schedule, article, parts, chapters, sections, subsections, clauses, points, schedules, articles, metadata, header_footer_text, watermark_text. Specific keys: part_number, part_title, chapter_number, chapter_title, section_number, section_title, subsection_number, clause_letter, subclause_number, article_number, schedule_number, schedule_title, point_marker, content, paragraph, text_block, explanation, proviso, note, inference_note.

    Consistency: Apply chosen key names consistently throughout the JSON.

    Identifier Keys: Use distinct keys for identifiers (numbers/letters/markers) vs. content/titles. E.g., { "section_number": "५", "content": "..." }.

Final Goal: Produce the most logical, navigable, and semantically rich JSON representation of the provided Nepali legal text, maximizing the capture of its inherent structure by rigorously analyzing the semantic numbering and indexing sequences (ignoring page numbers), handling repetitive elements appropriately, while guaranteeing the inclusion of every single piece of unique text from the input document according to the rules specified above. The final JSON structure should be the model's best determination based on these principles and the specific input document.
